This was my first project using pygame. I started off just using the library to generate random white pixels, then I made a function to plot basic math equations. The code isn't super clean but it's in a working state and I wanted to upload what I got done over the weekend.

You can use the cursor to place circles of grass, which are needed for the dandelions to grow/spread. '-' and '=' will place different sized circles. There's also a "go" boolean and a corresponding line commented out on line 131 which you can uncomment and view each iteration within the simulation.

After laying out some grass, you can press space and watch the dandelions grow! The pattern the spread in could definitely be better, but I managed to implement a wind feature, so they could be blown in different directions, and I improved the spreading pattern from what it was originally.
